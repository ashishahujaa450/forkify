## Updates to food2fork API

Hey there,

If you have not yet reached the forkify app project, please just ignore this message.

As you know, the forkify project requires an API, which used to be food2fork. However, this API shut down some time ago.

As an alternative, Jonas have developed a new API, which is basically the same as food2fork. You can read all about it in this lecture (which jonas posted right at the time food2fork shut down on Udemy): NEW food2fork API

You can also see the forkify API documentation right here: https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/

Jonas still see a LOT of confusion around this, which is why he decided to post this announcement. I hope it is cleared now.

So, the forkify app did NOT stop working, just swap the API and you're fine :)

Happy coding!
